# Day 1: OSI Model - Cybersecurity Basics

---

## What is OSI Model?

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** Model is a 7-layer framework that describes how data moves across a network.  
It helps in standardizing networking protocols and troubleshooting.

## The 7 Layers of OSI Model (Top to Bottom)

| Layer No. | Layer Name      | Function                                      |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 7         | Application     | User interface (e.g., browsers, apps)         |
| 6         | Presentation    | Data formatting, encryption, compression      |
| 5         | Session         | Connection management (start, maintain, end)  |
| 4         | Transport       | Reliable data delivery (TCP/UDP, segmentation)|
| 3         | Network         | Routing, IP addressing                        |
| 2         | Data Link       | MAC addressing, error detection               |
| 1         | Physical        | Cables, signals, transmission hardware        |

## Mnemonic to Remember

**All People Seem To Need Data Processing**

---

## Cybersecurity Relevance

- **Layer 3 (Network):** IP Spoofing  
- **Layer 4 (Transport):** SYN Flood  
- **Layer 7 (Application):** SQL Injection, XSS  

Most cyber attacks occur in layers 3 to 7 — knowing these layers helps identify and secure vulnerabilities.

## Tip

Focus more on **Layers 3 to 7** as a cybersecurity student — these are critical in understanding how most attacks work.
