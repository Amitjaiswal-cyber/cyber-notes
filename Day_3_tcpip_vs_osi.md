## üß© Key Differences Between OSI and TCP/IP Models

| Feature                  | OSI Model                          | TCP/IP Model                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Full Form               | Open Systems Interconnection        | Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol |
| Layers                  | 7 Layers                           | 4 Layers                         |
| Layer Names             | Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical | Application, Transport, Internet, Network Interface |
| Developed By            | ISO (International Standards Org)  | US Department of Defense (DoD)  |
| Protocol Independence   | Protocol-independent               | Protocol-specific (TCP, IP etc.)|
| Usage                   | Theoretical model                  | Practical implementation model  |
| Approach                | Vertical (layer-by-layer concept)  | Horizontal (end-to-end flow)     |
| Communication           | Both connection-oriented & connectionless | Mostly connectionless (UDP) or connection-oriented (TCP) |
| Data Unit              | Segment, Packet, Frame, Bits        | Segment, Datagram, Frame, Bits  |

## üìö Summary

- OSI is a **conceptual** model to understand network systems clearly, while TCP/IP is the **actual protocol stack** used on the Internet.
- OSI has 7 layers; TCP/IP has 4, combining some OSI layers.
- OSI is great for **learning and design**, but **TCP/IP is used in real-world networking**.
